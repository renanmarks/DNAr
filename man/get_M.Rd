\title{Returns the matrix M.}
\usage{
get_M(reactions, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{reactions}{A vector with the reactions of the CRN.}

\item{species}{A vector with the species of the reaction. The order of
this vector is important because it will define the
column order of the returned behavior.}
}
\value{
A list with the named indexes \code{prod} (stoichiometry matrix of the
products), \code{react} (stoichiometry matrix of reactants) and \code{M}
(the M matrix generate from the difference of theses two matrices).
}
\description{
The matrix M is used for the calculations made on \code{\link{react}()}.
This matrix  has #lines = #reactions and #columns = #species and it
represents the stoichiometry of each species at each reaction.
